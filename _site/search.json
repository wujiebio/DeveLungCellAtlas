        "content"  : "ResearchOur lab will mainly use computational approaches combined with experiments to understand RNA virus and RNA structure at gene expression regulation and structural levels.Specifically, we use RNA structure prediction and RNA design to udnerstand and engineer RNA molecules. We are hosting the RNA-Puzzles, which is a world-wide community efforts in evaluation of RNA 3D structure prediction. We explore RNA structural biology using a combination of X-ray crystallography, chemical probing, artificial intelligence and computational modeling. Besides, we use single-cell multi-omics to understand the human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We develop computational algorithms to deal with key bottlenecks in single-cell analysis (e.g.,batch effect, cell type clustering, cell type deconvolution). We also develop cloud computing platform and big data atlases for single-cell omics.Here are some themes that we currently work on (RNA-Puzzles, RNA design, Single-cell omics algorithms, Single-cell omics data analysis ):RNA-Puzzles.It is a world-wide community experiment for blind RNA structure prediction.  It aims to:  To determine the capabilities and limitations of current methods of 3D RNA structure prediction based on sequence;  To find whether and how progress has been made, as well as what has yet to be done to achieve better solutions  To identify whether there are specific bottlenecks that hold back the field;  To promote the available methods and guide potential users in the choice of suitable tools for real-world problems;  To encourage the RNA structure prediction community in their efforts to improve the current tools and to make automated prediction tools available.  To explore the underlying mechanism of ligand-RNA binding and the conformational changes in riboswitches.  For details, please visit rnapuzzles.org.  The image is a screenshot of our RNA-Puzzles webpage.RNA design.We aim to design catalytic RNA molecule as well as RNA inhibitors using the RNA structure folding rules. It is widely known that RNA form base-pairs and secondary structures. However, the “base-pairs” are normally referring to cis-Watson-Crick base-pairs of A-U or G=C, sometimes G-U, while the non-Watson-Crick base-pairs also play a key role in RNA structure formation. We aim to integrate experimental information and RNA structural rules derived from X-ray crystal structures to optimise RNA design including the non-Watson-Crick base-pairs.  The image is a description about all the base-pair conformations from our Annual Reveiew of Biophysics paper.Single-cell omics algorithms.Single-cell multi-omics and spatial technologies now provide an opportunity to dissect the state of individual cells at unprecedented resolution. Given the rapid development of different single-cell technologies and new wave of big omics data with their own specificities in terms of complexity and information content, our aims is to develop new computational and theoretical approaches to deal with big single-cell omics data to derive novel biological insights. We aim to understand the spatialand temporal cellular response to RNA viruses.  The image is a cover picture of our SCCAF algorithm.Single-cell omics data analysis.We use computational analysis to understand the bioligcal significance bebind single-cell omics data. Especially, we are interested in human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We welcome collaborators around but also beyond these topics.  The image is a cover picture of our single-cell research on neuron stem cell in adult primates."

        "content"  : "Use this website as a template for your academic research groupThis website is powered by Jekyll and uses some Bootstrap and  Bootswatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to re-use it for your purpose.Getting startedAll pages are written in markdown for easy editing, and Jekyll uses Liquid for the data-driven pages. The publicaion list, news items, and group members are stored as .yml data sheets (plain text) in the _data folder, so that one can update the website easily. The pages are in the _pages folder. Updating and maintaining is easy using Github (not worldpress-easy, but there are other advantages (see e.g. this, or this). Jekyll takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful html files in the _site folder.If you never used Jekyll, read the wikipedia article article and check out their website. Same for Github, which will host your first website draft.Create and open a github account, go to our repository, and click ‘fork’. This is now your copy of the website, and you can change and adapt it as you want. You don’t have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it). Then change the name of the repository to “your_username” and the name of the branch to “gh-pages”.  Your website is now automatically published under your_username.github.io/your_username/. Except that it probably still looks like our website.To modify the webpage, you can either do everything on on github.com (go to a file, click “edit”, then “commit”, “push”), or install  Jekyll on your computer and play with your local copy that you sync with the branch on github.com.  The former is much easier in the beginning, but a bit less convenient once you start rewriting everythint. To get it to work on your computer (and to learn a bit more about Jekyll), here and here are tutorials on how to use it and how set it up locally. Also, consider using the Github desktop app, I found it helpful.CustomizationNow let’s make this your website.First, go to the news.ylm, publist.ylm, and team.ylm files in the _data folder and insert your own data into the data fields. Watch out:  Jekyll is quite strict about extra or missing spaces etc. Adhere to the format. In the beginning, test each change: commit, push, and check the published website.For publications, you can add a “1” in the highlight field, then it will be featured prominently. You can add important  news items (red, “news1”), and less important  news items (blue, “news2”).For the news items, just keep adding them. The first 10 will be displayed on the ‘home’ page.For the team.ylm fileNext, change the content of all files in the _pages folder.  To change the title in the homepage, go to homelay.html in the _layout folder.Lastly, change the footer and perhaps header appropriately (in _include).You might also want to change the style or theme. I imported style files (in sass) from Bootstrap/Bootwatch, you can replace them with your own (in the _sass directory). For small changes, just work on the override stuff in the main.sass file in the CSS folder. Or change some variables in the _variables.sass file, like the background color etc.As said, Jekyll takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful html files in the _site folder.In the end, either upload these files  to your server, or buy yourself a domain and check the instructions on github on how to host it there.Copyright / creditYou can use this template as you please. You don’t have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it). We also welcome it if you send us an email with a link to your website, perhaps we’ll publish a list here at some point.Comments welcome.Code released under the MIT License."

        "content"  : "ResearchOur lab will mainly use computational approaches combined with experiments to understand RNA virus and RNA structure at gene expression regulation and structural levels.Specifically, we use RNA structure prediction and RNA design to udnerstand and engineer RNA molecules. We are hosting the RNA-Puzzles, which is a world-wide community efforts in evaluation of RNA 3D structure prediction. We explore RNA structural biology using a combination of X-ray crystallography, chemical probing, artificial intelligence and computational modeling. Besides, we use single-cell multi-omics to understand the human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We develop computational algorithms to deal with key bottlenecks in single-cell analysis (e.g.,batch effect, cell type clustering, cell type deconvolution). We also develop cloud computing platform and big data atlases for single-cell omics.Here are some themes that we currently work on (RNA-Puzzles, RNA design, Single-cell omics algorithms, Single-cell omics data analysis ):RNA-Puzzles.It is a world-wide community experiment for blind RNA structure prediction.  It aims to:  To determine the capabilities and limitations of current methods of 3D RNA structure prediction based on sequence;  To find whether and how progress has been made, as well as what has yet to be done to achieve better solutions  To identify whether there are specific bottlenecks that hold back the field;  To promote the available methods and guide potential users in the choice of suitable tools for real-world problems;  To encourage the RNA structure prediction community in their efforts to improve the current tools and to make automated prediction tools available.  To explore the underlying mechanism of ligand-RNA binding and the conformational changes in riboswitches.  For details, please visit rnapuzzles.org.  The image is a screenshot of our RNA-Puzzles webpage.RNA design.We aim to design catalytic RNA molecule as well as RNA inhibitors using the RNA structure folding rules. It is widely known that RNA form base-pairs and secondary structures. However, the “base-pairs” are normally referring to cis-Watson-Crick base-pairs of A-U or G=C, sometimes G-U, while the non-Watson-Crick base-pairs also play a key role in RNA structure formation. We aim to integrate experimental information and RNA structural rules derived from X-ray crystal structures to optimise RNA design including the non-Watson-Crick base-pairs.  The image is a description about all the base-pair conformations from our Annual Reveiew of Biophysics paper.Single-cell omics algorithms.Single-cell multi-omics and spatial technologies now provide an opportunity to dissect the state of individual cells at unprecedented resolution. Given the rapid development of different single-cell technologies and new wave of big omics data with their own specificities in terms of complexity and information content, our aims is to develop new computational and theoretical approaches to deal with big single-cell omics data to derive novel biological insights. We aim to understand the spatialand temporal cellular response to RNA viruses.  The image is a cover picture of our SCCAF algorithm.Single-cell omics data analysis.We use computational analysis to understand the bioligcal significance bebind single-cell omics data. Especially, we are interested in human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We welcome collaborators around but also beyond these topics.  The image is a cover picture of our single-cell research on neuron stem cell in adult primates."
